<h1>Proxy Server</h1>
<p>A proxy server is a server that sits between the client and the remote server.
<br>
If the requested URL is in the lists which we mentioned earlier (in a text files in Group folder),
then the proxy server won't allow connection to the destination server.
</p>
<p>
* This Proxy works only on HTTP websites.
</p>
<p>
* Before use, you should set IP Address and Port (8080) in your network setting (web proxy server field).
